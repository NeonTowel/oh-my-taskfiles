If you must run the UI locally to test it, always change to the `./ui` directory and run `bun run dev`. If that fails, examine the `ui/package.json` to see what commands are available.

Also note that the UI might already be running. In this case, skip running the UI and proceed to test it with for example: 
`curl http://localhost:5173`. If the UI appears to be running but not responsive, ask the user which address the server is listening on.

Generally use `bun` for package management, not `npm` or `yarn`.
