If you must run the api locally to test it, always change to the ./api directory and run 'bun run dev'.

Also note that the API might already be running. In this case, skip running the api with wrangler and proceed to test it with for example: curl http://localhost:8787

Generally use `bun` for package management, not `npm` or `yarn`.
